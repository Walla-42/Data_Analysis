# Data Analysis Projects in Python

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of data analysis projects I have completed in Python, focusing on tabular data. These projects showcase my experience with the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
<!-- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Machine learning and predictive modeling.-->

## Repository Contents

1. **Cause of Death Analysis**
   - Explores cause-of-death data for Utah and the United States.
   - Involves cleaning, processing, and visualizing trends to uncover patterns.

2. **Admission Algorithm**
   - Implements an algorithm to evaluate student admissions.
   - Provides scores for students and generates decision rankings based on these scores.

3. **Netflix Usage Analysis**
   - Tracks and analyzes my Netflix viewing habits.
   - Determines peak times and patterns for when I watched Netflix the most.

## Notes

- For most projects, the datasets are included in the repository to facilitate reproducibility.
- Some projects include only code as the original datasets have been lost. These examples are shared to illustrate my thought processes and analytical approaches.
- Most data analysis projects I have done are on my DataCamp profile which can be accessed here [![DataCamp](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataCamp-black?style=flat&logo=DataCamp&logoColor=Green&textColor=white)](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/loganpwallace)


Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and visualizations. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
