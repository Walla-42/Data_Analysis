This repository is a compilation of some of the data analysis I have done in python for tabular data. 
It shows some of the experience I have using the numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn libraries in python. 
For some codes, the datasets have been lost. These codes are for presentation of my thought processes.
For the majority of codes in this repository I have also uploaded the datasets along with them.
